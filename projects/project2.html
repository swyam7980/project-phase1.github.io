            <h2>The Rising Threat of Global Warming</h2>
            <p><em>April 5, 2025</em></p>
          
            <section>
              <h3>🌍 Introduction</h3>
              <p>Global warming is no longer a distant concern—it's a present reality affecting every continent and ocean. From rising sea levels to increasingly extreme weather events, the Earth's climate is shifting in alarming ways.</p>
              <p>Global warming refers to the gradual increase in the Earth's average surface temperature, primarily due to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.</p>
              <p>The consequences of global warming are not confined to the environment. They extend to human health, food security, economies, and political stability. This article explores the causes, effects, scientific basis, and potential solutions to global warming, with the hope of spreading awareness and motivating meaningful action.</p>

              <h3>🔥 What Is Global Warming?</h3>
              <p>At its core, global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's climate system observed since the pre-industrial period. This warming is mainly driven by human activity, especially the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which release carbon dioxide (CO₂) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p>
              <p>The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon that warms the Earth's surface. Greenhouse gases trap some of the heat radiating from Earth, which would otherwise escape into space. While essential for life, excessive greenhouse gases intensify this effect, causing the planet to warm beyond natural levels.</p>

              <h3>🏭 Major Causes of Global Warming</h3>
              <p><strong>1. Burning of Fossil Fuels:</strong> Power plants, vehicles, and industries burn fossil fuels, emitting large amounts of CO₂, methane, and nitrous oxide.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Deforestation:</strong> Trees absorb carbon dioxide. When forests are cleared, the carbon stored in them is released, and their absorption capacity is lost.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Agriculture:</strong> Livestock emit methane during digestion, and fertilizers release nitrous oxide—both potent greenhouse gases.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Waste:</strong> Organic waste in landfills releases methane as it decomposes.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Industry:</strong> Cement, chemicals, and other industrial processes emit GHGs through combustion and chemical reactions.</p>

              <h3>🌊 Evidence of a Warming Planet</h3>
              <p>Scientific data shows Earth is warming. The last decade was the hottest on record. Arctic sea ice is melting, and global sea levels have risen over 8 inches since 1880.</p>
              <p>Heatwaves, floods, droughts, and hurricanes are becoming more extreme and frequent. Oceans are warmer, and glaciers are shrinking globally, affecting ecosystems and human livelihoods.</p>

            <section>
              <h3>🧪 The Science Behind It</h3>
              <p><strong>Temperature Rise:</strong> Earth’s temperature has increased by about 1.1°C since the late 1800s. Even a small increase causes major impacts on ecosystems, weather, and sea levels.</p>
              <p><strong>Greenhouse Gas Levels:</strong> CO₂ has risen from 280 ppm pre-industrially to over 420 ppm today, the highest in 800,000 years. Methane and nitrous oxide have risen too.</p>
              <p><strong>Ice Loss:</strong> Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are losing hundreds of billions of tons of ice annually. Glaciers are shrinking worldwide.</p>
              <p><strong>Ocean Impact:</strong> Oceans absorb over 90% of excess heat and are becoming more acidic due to dissolved CO₂, affecting marine life and coral reefs.</p>

              <h3>🚨 Effects of Global Warming</h3>
              <p><strong>1. Extreme Weather:</strong> More intense hurricanes, droughts, floods, and heatwaves threaten lives and economies.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Rising Seas:</strong> Coastal cities are at risk from sea level rise, driven by melting glaciers and thermal expansion of oceans.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Ecosystem Disruption:</strong> Species are migrating or facing extinction. Coral reefs are dying due to warming and acidification.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Food Insecurity:</strong> Changing climate affects crop yields, livestock, and water availability, endangering food supply.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Health Threats:</strong> Heat stress, air pollution, and spread of diseases like malaria and dengue are increasing.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Economic Damage:</strong> Disasters linked to global warming cost billions and disproportionately affect poor communities.</p>

              <p><strong>Protect Forests:</strong> Reforestation and halting deforestation help absorb atmospheric CO₂.</p>
              <p><strong>Green Transport:</strong> Biking, public transport, electric vehicles, and fuel-efficient cars lower emissions.</p>
              <p><strong>Efficient Living:</strong> Better insulation, efficient appliances, and responsible energy use can make a big impact.</p>
              <p><strong>Smart Consumption:</strong> Choose local, plant-based food; avoid fast fashion; reduce plastic use; recycle.</p>
              <p><strong>Climate Policy:</strong> Support carbon pricing, clean energy incentives, and global agreements like the Paris Agreement.</p>

              <h3>💬 Common Myths Debunked</h3>
              <p><strong>"Climate change is natural."</strong> While natural cycles exist, today’s warming is human-driven and rapid.</p>
              <p><strong>"It’s too late to act."</strong> Mitigating now prevents worse outcomes. Every fraction of a degree matters.</p>
              <p><strong>"Cold weather disproves warming."</strong> Weather is short-term; climate is long-term. Climate change causes unpredictable patterns.</p>
